# SimpleStaffChat
 
a plugin to simply communicate with the staff member

formally made for a shitty server that ended up doxxing and swatting me when i asked to be paid.

fuck you guys.

the plugin was made somewhere in october 2021, when i started making plugins, so the code is as bad as the way to build it.

as a matter of fact, i don't remember how tf did i built it, i'll update it to make it buildable with gradlew.

made for 1.16.5, but should work in updated versions.

might re-work on it to add features (like Bungee support)

the only things that changed between the 2021 version and that one is the classes path that has been changed (to avoid getting some private infos leaked)
